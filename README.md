# Steampunk Contraptions
Current quantum computations seem like 19th century contraptions on the verge of collapse.

This repository explores several areas in the NISQ era that need attention if we are ever to achieve fault tolerant logical gates.

## Nicole Yunger Halpern
Nicole Yunger Halpern unites quantum information theory with thermodynamics in what she has named *quantum steampunk*.

## Amit Hagar
Amit Hagar maintains healthy pessimism whether large scale quantum computers can ever be more efficient than their classical counterparts in the open thermodynamic systems needed for computation.

## Circuit Complexity

The classic article on circuit complexity is Nielsen's clearly organized and beautiful paper:
```
  Michael A. Nielsen
  A geometric approach to quantum circuit lower bounds
```

(https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0502070.pdf), 2/2005, 29 pages

He finds a lower bound on the minimal size in the length of the minimal geodesic between a gate, U, and the identity, I, where length is defined by a Finsler metric on the manifold SU(2^n). Finding the length of the minimal Pauli geodesic passing from I to U is
equivalent to solving an exponential size instance of the closest vector in a lattice problem (CVP).
